# Credit Card Validator - Takes in a credit card number from a
# common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express,
# Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid
# number (look into how credit cards use a checksum).

# This program works with *most* credit card numbers.


# Uses Luhn Algorithm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).

# 1. From the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, moving
# left, double the value of every second digit; if product of this
# doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g., 7 * 2 = 14), then
# sum the digits of the products (e.g., 10: 1 + 0 = 1, 14: 1 + 4 = 5).

# 2. Add together doubled digits with the undoubled digits from the
# original number.

# 3. If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero)
# then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; else it is
# not valid.

function isvalid_luhn(orig_digits::Vector{Int})
    # double alternate digits (step 1)
    doubled_digits = [iseven(i) ? d : 2d for (i,d) in enumerate(orig_digits)]
    # sum digits of number > 10 (step 2)
    summed_digits = [d < 10 ? d : sum(digits(d)) for d=doubled_digits]
    # step 3
    sum(summed_digits) % 10 == 0
end

print("Enter the credit card number of check: ")
number = reverse(digits(int(replace(readline(STDIN),' ', ""))))
answer = isvalid_luhn(number) ? "valid" : "invalid"
println("The number is $answer")
